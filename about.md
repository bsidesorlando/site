    BSides Orlando is a community organized event, driven by the passion to connect people together, whether it’s to build relationships for a project, or to get to know your fellow professionals.

    BSides Orlando is run like a typical security conference, with tracks and various villages, but we differ in our approach to speakers and attendees. We encourage new and aspiring speakers to present for the first time, and provide access to industry veterans to have a conversation beyond asking a few questions at the end. Industry veterans benefit by getting fresh perspectives on their projects or ideas and access to central Florida's information security talent pool.

    We aim to inspire a passion for security. Major conferences often focus on current hot button topics, while BSides Orlando and similar BSides events often cover topics that don’t get the big spotlight, but should be discussed. This includes anything from learning how to prototype electronics projects to discussing the ethics of target rich environments in a pentest.

    Each BSides is a community-driven framework for building events for and by information security community members.  

    The goal is to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time.  It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening.
