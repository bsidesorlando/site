Get ready for the Social Engineering Adventure

Social Engineering Adventure is a fun filled village that focuses on the human side of cybersecurity. You'll get the opportunity to learn about some of the techniques used by the best in the industry. We'll have talks from professionals throughout the day, exact schedule will be released closer to the live event. Talks are 'Can a Hacker Murder a City?' from Patrick Laverty, 'The Voice of Deception: How Vishing Exploits Human Emotion' by Rosa Rowles, and 'Is it Real or Is it Memorex - Memorex is a Deepfake' given by James McQuiggan.

The village will feature OSINT Contest, from just a picture, can you figure out where that picture was taken? Do you think you can learn information about someone, starting with just a small piece of information?

Not enough? Try your hand at a phishing challenge against an AI bot!

What techniques do the professionals use to build trust, build rapport with people and get them to divulge information that perhaps they shouldn't be giving out? Learn how psychology can be used to build relationships with people in a short amount of time.


Join us at Social Engineering Adventure, where learning meets fun!
