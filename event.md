    SunshineCTF is back for its 9th year in conjunction with BSides Orlando 2024 and hosted by current and former members of Hack@UCF. This year’s competition will include categories like pwn, reverse engineering, web, crypto, scripting, and something special!

    SunshineCTF is an online competition that’s open to anyone, though some prizes (TBD) may only be given to the top-ranked in-person team(s) during the BSides Orlando closing ceremony.

    Registration is hosted at <a href="https://sunshinectf.org/">https://sunshinectf.org/</a>, and you can check out last year's event on

      The Lockpick Village is a physical security demonstration and participation area. Visitors can learn about the vulnerabilities of various locking devices, and techniques used to exploit them, and practice locks of various difficulty levels to try themselves. By exploring the faults and flaws in many popular lock designs, you can not only learn about the fun hobby of sportpicking, but also gain much stronger knowledge about the best methods and practices for protecting your own property.
