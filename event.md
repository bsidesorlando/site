### <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/se_village/">Social Engineering Adventure</a>
Hack the human element. At the SE Adventure Village, explore how persuasion, psychology, and trust are used to gain access — and how to defend against it.  
Expect <strong>OSINT challenges</strong>, an <strong>AI Vishing Contest</strong>, and live talks that mix fun with practical takeaways.

### <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/career_village/">Career Village</a>
Level up your career journey. Career Village offers:
- Resume reviews  
- Professional headshots  
- Mock interviews  
- A job board of open positions  
Plus fun networking games like <strong>BINGO</strong> and a <strong>Scavenger Hunt</strong> that will take you across the con. Check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/career_village/">Career Village page</a> for tips to get the most out of it.

### Community Village
Cybersecurity is bigger than one event. Meet local community groups, learn what they’re building, and discover how you can get involved year-round.

### Sponsor Village
The companies and organizations that make BSides Orlando possible are here to meet you! Stop by their tables to check out demos, opportunities, and (of course) swag.

## Talks & Unconference

### Unconference
Your voice belongs here. Sign up onsite to give a lightning talk (15 minutes or less) on anything you want to share — tools, tips, war stories, or ideas. Short, sharp, and community-driven, the Unconference stage is always full of surprises.

### Village Talks
Many villages feature their own short talks and demos. Drop by for sessions on topics like lockpicking basics, deepfake detection, vishing, and more. Check the onsite schedule for times and details.

## Info & Logistics

### Information & Swag
Registration and swag pickup are streamlined with split lines this year. Every attendee gets sponsor goodies and a collectible BSides Orlando sticker sheet. Trade extras at the sticker table and expand your collection.

### Workshops
Workshops run the day before the main con. Past sessions have included malware forensics with Volatility 3, IoT hacking labs, and threat modeling. Space is limited, so plan ahead — details are at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/workshops/">bsidesorlando.org/workshops</a>.
