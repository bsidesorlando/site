## How to Report Unacceptable Behavior
**Option 1: If you feel unsafe, speak up. See it, say it, sort it.**
If you are disrespected, or witness this happening to someone else, engage politely with the person involved, if you feel able to, and let them know that you
find their behavior unacceptable and offensive. Sometimes the best way to change unacceptable behavior is by bringing it to the perpetrator’s attention
and giving them an opportunity to acknowledge this and apologize.
**Option 2: Report it to BSides Orlando staff via any of the following ways:**
- Inform a member of our event staff who can be identified by their badge.
- Email us at security@bsidesorlando.org.
- Complete our event feedback form (this can be done anonymously), which will be sent out to all attendees after the event concludes.
When reporting, please provide as much detail as possible, preferably:
- Your name and contact details (email, cell/mobile phone, and address).
- The time it occurred.
- The place it occurred.
- The names and contact details of any witnesses.
- The outcome you are expecting (e.g. letter of apology, steps taken to prevent a similar instance from occurring, etc.)
*Note: you can remain anonymous if you so wish and providing any of the above information is optional.
Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please report the
situation to us as indicated above.
We don’t have a time limit for reporting unacceptable behavior, although we encourage you to do it as quickly as possible, as it can be difficult to obtain
accurate witness statements the longer time passes. If you report unacceptable behavior more than three months after an incident, you should explain
why as it may impact the ability to respond accordingly. We will consider your explanation and then endeavor to deal with your report.*
## How We Handle Unacceptable Behavior
We are committed to ensuring that you experience a positive, enjoyable and inclusive event. We strive for customer service excellence when reporting
unacceptable behavior. That’s why, for the duration of our event, we will have a number of reporting mechanisms available (e.g., suitable informed event
staff, event feedback forms, etc.). When you report unacceptable behavior to us, we will respond promptly and with care, consideration, and respect. Our
process does not replace nor remove the formal mechanisms available to you as an individual to report inappropriate or offensive behavior such as making
a police report. Our process is as follows:
- We will acknowledge your report and reply via email (if an email was sent) as soon as is practical.
- We will perform a thorough investigation starting immediately.
- We will not comment on your experience or perception of it.
- We will keep it wholly professional and confidential.
- We will treat all of the people involved fairly and objectively, irrespective of what our relationship with them is.
- We will apply the appropriate sanctions/remediation (e.g., warnings, direction to learning resources on the topic of
harassment, bullying or anti-social behavior, temporary or permanent suspensions, and if necessary, report them to the police).
We will take into consideration your wishes in any enforcement.
- We will suggest measures we can take to ensure incidents of this nature do not recur at future events.
- We reserve the right to remove people from the event or prevent people from joining the event.
- We will not name and shame individuals, but we will analyze our progress with regards to unacceptable behavior and publish our findings annually on our website.
