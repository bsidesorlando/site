## Volunteer at BSides Orlando
We're excited you want to join the BSides Orlando Family! Those interested in helping out are encouraged to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/rQQxBqr9FM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orlando Bsides Discord</a> and  sign up through this  <a href="https://forms.gle/7awwaAxxAZHx2Qw4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">form</a> to be informed about our volunteer needs.

Several slots are available to do general event prep on Friday, September 26th, as well as soldering roles, registration roles, afterparty roles (and more!) on Saturday, September 27th! Additional sign up details will be shared via Discord or email once the above form is completed.
