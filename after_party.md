# After Party!

Join us after the Conference to unwind and hang out! There will be board games, cash bar, music, and awesome people to talk to! The party starts at 7 pm and ends at 10, down at the Celeste Ballroom. Just go down University Blvd and turn left on Alafaya Trail, and onto Strategy Blvd, and you're there!
