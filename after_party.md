# A note from the Chairlizard

## Subject: ðŸ¦Ž Little Chompy Demands Your Presence at the After Party!

*Listen up, humans. The conference may be done, but I your chairlizard, Little Chompy (a.k.a. the Syslog Snapper, the Kernel Chomper, the scaly boss of all things BSides Orlando), have decreed there shall beâ€¦ AFTER PARTY. Thatâ€™s rightâ€”board games, music, a cash bar, and probably way too many awkward networking moments that youâ€™ll laugh about later. Starts at 7pm sharp in the Celeste ballroom and goes until 10pm, or until someone flips the Monopoly board.*

*So come hang out. Tell your favorite speaker how awesome their talk was, battle your fellow hackers over cardboard kingdoms, and let me bask in the glory of your questionable dance moves. Be thereâ€¦ or risk eternal chompification.*

*I had my minions hand draw maps to help you find your way to the party. You have your choice of [Apple flavored](https://maps.apple.com/place?place-id=I1F6079BF27EAAE75&address=4105+N+Alafaya+Trail%2C+Orlando%2C+FL+32826%2C+United+States) or [Google flavored](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=The+Celeste+Hotel,+Orlando,+a+Tribute+Portfolio+Hotel). I told them we needed fish flavored but they didn't listen so good. Stupid minions.*

*Don't want to be driving home so late at night? I don't blame you. All Florida drivers are horrible and they're twice as bad after the sun goes down. Except me. Obviously. I am an incredible driver. Anyway, don't go spreading this around, but the hotel manager is a close personal friend of the Chompinator and I got us a screamin' deal on rooms. Which is pretty impressive because this is a real classy joint and they don't just give these deals to any old reptile. You just follow [this link](https://bsorl.org/room-block) and tell 'em Little Chompy sent you. They'll take good care of you. But you better book before September 18th because the deal doesn't last forever.*

*So let us recap. After Party. 7 to 10 in the PM evening. Super swanky Celeste Hotel. Questionable dance moves. Yes. Great. That's all the relevant information. Also, the card you chose at the beginning of this trick was the 3 of clubs. Yes. I know. It's amazing how I knew that. You are so impressed.*

*I look forward to chomping you at the After Party.*

*-Little Chompy, BSides Orlando Chairlizard*
