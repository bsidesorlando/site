# “Lost Signal” – A Space Adventure Featuring Chompy & Ypmohc (IP-mock)

## Scene 1: A Curious Beginning 

> Young Chompy, still just an egg, is already curious about the world—and beyond. He sits at a computer, tapping out messages and beaming them into space using an old amateur radio satellite: OSCAR-7.

## Scene 2: Years of Silent Friendship 

> Chompy grows up, never knowing who (or what) is on the other end. But the messages keep coming. Across the stars, Ypmohc, an alien gator who looks a lot like Chompy (but blue), receives them. Over time, a secret friendship grows—words exchanged across lightyears through outdated tech.

## Scene 3: The Signal Fades 

> One day, the satellite goes dark. The connection is lost. Chompy continues his work, not knowing if anyone’s still out there. The silence lasts for years.

## Scene 4: Contact Returns 

> Then—out of nowhere—OSCAR-7 comes back online.
> A message arrives:

👉 "I’m on my way to pick you up." 👈

## Scene 5: First Contact 
> Ypmohc beams down in a bright light and finally meets Chompy face-to-face. They both freeze in surprise—mirroring the classic Spider-Man pointing meme. Despite being worlds apart, they see how similar they are.

## Scene 7: The Return 
> After exploring the stars together, Chompy gives Ypmohc a thumbs-up and heads back to Florida. He’s eager to share his journey—and to let others know that sometimes the friends we’ve never met might be the ones who know us best.
